How to build and run a fivechess server:
1.Open a terminal in linux.
2.Input 'cd ./FiveChessServer'.
3.Input 'make' to compile the code.
4.Input 'make clean' to remove such '*.o' files.
5.Input 'fivechess' to run a server. 

Note: Before you run a server, you need to set the configration for a server by the
     'config.cfg' file according to your own machine.

Below is my developing environment:
  Ubuntu 18.04 (x86_64)
  Libevent-2.1.8-stable
  MySQL-5.7.23 (x86_64)
  VsCode 

May you have a nice time.
